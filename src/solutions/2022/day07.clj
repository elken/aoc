;; ## Solution
;; Another whiplash back to difficulty. This one stumped me for a little bit,
;; took a while to have the sizes compute recursively cleanly. But we made it,
;; so let's run through everything.
;;
;; Today, we have an interesting one; we have to understand a directory tree
;; from a listing of commands!
;;
;; The demo input explains things quite well, but in essence we have to create a
;; mapping of all the directory sizes, then reason on it. The first thought here
;; screams "build a tree!", but it turns out to actually be quite overkill. All
;; we need to care about is the total size of a directory, so we can maintain
;; everything in a simple map.
;;
;; First things first, let's load our input and parse it
(def input (->> (slurp (io/resource "inputs/2022/day07.txt")) ;; Load the resource
                (str/split-lines)))                            ;; Split into lines

;; A helper function to help compute the meat of the problem.
;;
;; Given the current directory stack and a size, recurse calling with an empty size map and parsing the size.
;;
;; Given the current directory stack, a map of all the current sizes and a new
;; size; recurse up the directory stack and update the size for every entry.
