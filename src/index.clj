;; # ðŸŽ„ Advent of Clerk
;;
;; [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) with
;; [Clerk](https://clerk.vision).
;;
;; Solutions authored by [@elken](https://github.com/elken/) with love in Clojure. ðŸ’•
;;
;; Below is a listing of all my solutions grouped by year.
;;
;; All the solutions also include the original problem spec, along with my commentary.
;;
;; Should be obvious, but this will fully spoil any days; so if you haven't yet
;; completed a particular day I would suggest you do so first. But, I'm also not
;; your parent so go nuts.
;;
;; Greatly inspired by [advent of clerk](https://github.com/nextjournal/advent-of-clerk)
